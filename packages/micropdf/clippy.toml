# Clippy configuration for micropdf-rs

# Allow raw pointer dereference in FFI functions
# This is safe in our FFI layer because:
# 1. All FFI functions are marked with #[unsafe(no_mangle)]
# 2. All pointer dereferences are checked for null before use
# 3. All pointer dereferences are wrapped in unsafe blocks
# This is standard practice for C FFI bindings
